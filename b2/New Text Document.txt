ðŸ”¬ Conceptual Questions & Answers (Simple & Short)
What are outliers, and why do we remove them?
Outliers are values that are very different from the rest of the data. We remove them because they can affect analysis and give misleading results.

What is the IQR method, and how does it help in identifying outliers?
IQR (Interquartile Range) is the range between Q1 (25%) and Q3 (75%). We use it to find outliers beyond 1.5 Ã— IQR from the quartiles.

Why did you choose 1.5 Ã— IQR? Can it be changed?
1.5 Ã— IQR is a standard rule to detect mild outliers. Yes, it can be changed if needed (e.g., 3 Ã— IQR for extreme outliers).

How does removing outliers affect your analysis?
It makes the data cleaner and improves accuracy in graphs or models.

Whatâ€™s the difference between statistical outliers and visual outliers?
Statistical outliers are removed using methods like IQR. Visual outliers may still show in a boxplot even after that, based on the new IQR.

What other methods can detect outliers?
Z-score, Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, or manual domain-based limits.

ðŸ§ª Practical/Code-Based Questions & Answers
Explain the remove_outliers function.
It finds Q1, Q3, and IQR, then removes values below Q1 - 1.5*IQR and above Q3 + 1.5*IQR.

Why create a new DataFrame?
To avoid issues with NaNs (gaps) in the original data and make seaborn plot correctly.

Why do you still see dots in the boxplot?
Those are not global outliersâ€”they are points above the whisker in the cleaned data. Seaborn shows them as fliers.

What does plt.ylim(0, 25) do?
It fixes the y-axis range to always show from 0 to 25, for consistent viewing.

What if so2 has NaN values?
We should use dropna() before or during cleaning: series.dropna().

How do you know outliers were removed?
By checking the length before and after cleaning and by printing the new min and max values.

ðŸ“Š Visualization & Interpretation â€“ Simple Answers
What does the boxplot tell us about the distribution of SOâ‚‚ levels?
It shows the spread of data, the median, and any possible outliers. The box represents the middle 50% of the values.

What does the presence or absence of fliers (dots) mean?
If dots (fliers) are shown, it means there are values higher or lower than the expected range based on IQR.

How can you customize the boxplot to make it more informative?
You can change colors, rotate labels, add titles, hide outliers (showfliers=False), or set a fixed y-axis range.

How would you present this analysis in a report or dashboard?
I would add a title, label axes, remove fliers if needed, and explain in one line that outliers were removed to show a clean distribution.
